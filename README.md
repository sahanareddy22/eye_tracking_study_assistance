Eye tracking enables real-time analysis of visual attention and information processing, providing reliable, objective data on attention allocation and offering unique insights into these cognitive dynamics in educational contexts. Visual perception is crucial for both teachers and students to distill relevant information in complex classroom scenarios, making temporal analysis of attention patterns essential for understanding learning processes.
This research provides evidence-based insights for curriculum design, instructional timing, and adaptive learning systems that respond to real-time attention patterns, ultimately enhancing educational effectiveness through precision analysis of visual attention dynamics.
